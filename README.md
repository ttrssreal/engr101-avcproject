# AVCProject Team 28

**EMAILS**

Samuel Catalan: catalasamu@myvuw.ac.nz

James Churchill: churchjame2@myvuw.ac.nz

Viraj Patel: patelvira2@myvuw.ac.nz

**ROLES**

Coordinator: Viraj Patel. The coordinator is responsible for the overall management of the project, these include but are not limited to; assigning tasks/goals to other team members, maintaining and coordinating every other member to work effectively, and set deadlines for the project. The coordinator connects the other assigned roles in moulding the overall project.

Tester/Developer: James Churchill. This assigned role is responsible for testing and developing the software, and to verify whether the software functions and meets the requirements (for the task and end-users). They design software plans, code it, and create test plans to ensure the robustness and functionality. 

Architect: Sam Catalan, they are in charge of the design of the robot being used and buidling it. 




**GENERAL IDEA OF SOFTWARE** 

The general of idea of the software is that it will be comprised of multiple programs.
Firstly it will begin with initialising all the hardware that the robot will be using to move, like connecting the raspberry pi, to the wifi and using that connecting to the move the robot. 

It will then begin decide which quadrant that it is currently in, as each quadrant has diffrerent obstacles. Then depending on the quadrant the software will then go to an infinite loops, where the software contacts the robot API, and the specific quadrant sensor algorithm is used, and then a corrospoinding, movement program for the quadrant is used, to move the robot, adjusting itâ€™s motors.
