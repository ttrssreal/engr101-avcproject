*Analysis of Project Progress*

What went according to plan?

In terms of the components of our plan that went accordingly, *developing the project plan* was concluded before the set due date. This early positive enabled us to attain a clear understanding of the project timeline, and a comprehensive lists of tasks to be completed, which will serve as a vital reference throughout the project. 

Furthermore, the tasks related to the *connect and establish a connection to the robot via wifi*, and *designing/developing/test the robot through basic movements* progressed smoothly. These tasks were executed accordingly to the project plan well before their respective deadlines. The success of these key functions helped will a play vital role in keeping everything on track (as we need to complete these in order to access the quadrant tasks).

What did not go according to plan?

The main task of our project plan as of 22nd of May that did not go to plan was *Constructing the robot based on the design*. While we formed a well-defined design for the robot, the actual construction process was much more challenging and time consuming. Whilst building, we encountered a few bottlenecks, slowing down our progress, and realised more time should have been allocated for this task in the project plan. 

What are bottlenecks, what is slowing the development?

*Resource limitation*. Specifically, for resource limitation, we faced issues as there were a limited supply of the required parts for the design of our robot. For instance, we faced limitations in sizes of nuts and bolts, limited options for the third wheel (non motor wheel), which lead to us to settle for the Dell logo piece as an alternative, and limitations in the availability for the materials/parts for the main platform and second floor of the robot.

*Time constraints and component compatibility*. Two significant bottlenecks we encountered were time constraints and component compatibility. In terms of time constraints, we realised we should have prioritised allocating more time for building the robot itself. Building the robot itself is a very time-intensive task, and we underestimated the time required. The tight deadline put pressure on the team to complete the task within a compressed schedule, potentially changing the way to clearly think/adapt and build a robot to our design. Regarding component compatibility, the challenges/bottlenecks we faced were due to the limited availability components/parts for the required design. For example, some of the parts we were searching did not fit with the main platform piece of our robot, while others did not align with our other components of the robot. As a result, we encountered delays as we had to search for alternative solutions and find compatible components or adapt existing ones. This issue extended the timeline for the construction phase.

Team recommendation on how to advance the Project?

In terms of progressing the project, we should prioritise the task of building the robot and spend *extra* time within the labs completing this, as it has a critical impact on subsequent tasks. Therefore, once we finish this quickly (80% done), we can start working on the quadrant tasks and get back on track (which will also diminish most of the current bottlenecks). 

Then, we could allocate our time to working on designing algorithms to assist our robot through the quadrant tasks (i.e following the black line, and tracking). Thereafter, we can get a testing plan constructed for testing each of the development of the quadrant tasks, and ensure the robotâ€™s functionality is robust.
