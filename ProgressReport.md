| Start date | Task Decription | Responsible Team Member | End Date | Actual Progress as per 22 of May |
|----------|----------|----------|----------|----------|
|9/05/2023|Develop the project plan|Viraj Patel|13/05/2023|Completed, written the plan and formed a clear path|
|16/05/2023|Design robot frame/components|Samuel Catalan|17/05/2023|Completed, formed a clear plan/design for the robot, and thought of required parts|
|16/05/2023|Construct the robot based on the design|Samuel Catalan|17/05/2023|80% Completed, need to work on camera holder but the foundation/majority of build is completed|
|17/05/2023|Connect and establish a connection to the robot via wifi, and check if it can exchange data|James Churchill, Viraj Patel|23/05/2023|Completed, developed connection via wifi to the robot| 
|17/05/2023|Begin developing a program/DESIGN to control the robot with basic movements (based on commands)|James Churchill, Samuel Catalan|25/05/2023|Completed the design, and now waiting for testing| 
|17/05/2023|Test the robot to check whether it can execute these movements from the server|James Churchill, Viraj Patel|25/05/2023|Completed, after testing, we deducted that the motors attached to the wheels work and the connection can translate data for basic movements| 
|24/05/2023|Code error identifying mechanisms/possible recovery procedure (data loss)|James Churchill|25/05/2023|Not started yet, later starting date planned| 
|23//05/2023|Develop quadrant 1: Open the gate by exchanging with the server over Wifi|James Churchill|25/05/2023|Not started yet, later starting date planned| 
|23/05/2023|Verify and run multiple tests under different conditions (with errors) and document the results|James Churchill, Viraj Patel|25/05/2023|Not started yet, later starting date planned| 
|23/05/2023|Refine the code/design for quadrant 1 (based on the success of the test)|James Churchill, Viraj Patel|25/05/2023|Not started yet, later starting date planned| 
|23/05/2023|Design idea for quadrant 2 (sensors), and make physical changes (if necessary)|James Churchill, Samuel Catalan|25/05/2023|Not started yet, later starting date planned| 
|24/05/2023|Develop a sensor program/algorithm to detect/follow the squiggly line and control movement|James Churchill|25/05/2023|Not started yet, later starting date planned| 
|24/05/2023|Verify and test quadrant 2 under different conditions, and document the results|James Churchill, Viraj Patel|25/05/2023|Not started yet, later starting date planned| 
|24/05/2023|Refine the code/design for quadrant 2 (based on the success of the test)|James Churchill, Viraj Patel|25/05/2023|Not started yet, later starting date planned| 
|30/05/2023|Design idea for line detection (possible algorithm to get through sharp turns)|James Churchill, Samuel Catalan|1/06/2023|Not started yet, later starting date planned| 
|30/05/2023|Develop a program for quadrant 3 (logic of direction selection)|James Churchill|1/06/2023|Not started yet, later starting date planned| 
|30/05/2023|Verify and test quadrant 3 under different conditions, and document the results|James Churchill, Viraj Patel|1/06/2023|Not started yet, later starting date planned| 
|30/05/2023|Refine code/design for quadrant 3 (based on the success of the test)|James Churchill, Viraj Patel|1/06/2023|Not started yet, later starting date planned| 
|31/05/2023|Design an idea for detecting the coloured cylinders, and avoiding them (another algorithm)|James Churchill, Samuel Catalan|1/06/2023|Not started yet, later starting date planned| 
|31/05/2023|Implement idea, and develop a program for quadrant 4|James Churchill|31/05/2023|Not started yet, later starting date planned| 
|31/05/2023|Verify and test quadrant 4 under different conditions, and document the results|James Churchill, Viraj Patel|1/05/2023|Not started yet, later starting date planned| 
|31/05/2023|Refine code/design for quadrant 4 (based off the success of the tests)|James Churchill, Viraj Patel|1/05/2023|Not started yet, later starting date planned| 
|Week 12 (29 May - 2nd June)|Present completed project to stakeholders|Viraj Patel|3/05/2023|Not started yet, later starting date planned| 
|Week 12|AVC Final report|James Churchill, Viraj Patel, Samuel Catalan|3rd June|Not started yet, later starting date planned|
